# PRISA documentation

## What is PRISA?

PRISA, or the Person Re-Identification System Application, is a web-based interface for using PRIS, the Person Re-Identification System developed by a previous team working under [Dr. Razib Iqbal](http://people.missouristate.edu/riqbal/) in the [Missouri State University computer science department](https://computerscience.missouristate.edu/). PRISA provides a user-friendly way to interact with the command-line only PRIS, as well as unbinding it from its rather harsh hardware requirements.

## How to use these docs

This documentation is intended for use by developers working on PRISA, and therefore is of limited use to any developers merely working *with* PRISA.

The documentation provided here is not a one-to-one representation of the code.

Some function names used in this documentation represent anonymous functions and are thereby not directly callable. In such cases, the documentation will make mention of this fact and provide information on how such functions can be accessed.

In the context of this documentation, namespaces represent convenient groupings of functions and do not directly correlate to traditional JavaScript namespaces.

## What *isn't* in these docs?

This documentation solely represents code written for the PRISA web server and as such does not contain any documentation of PRIS or of PRISA's Python subprocesses. It also contains only sparse documentation for inline JavaScript. Outside of those things, this documentation represents a complete writeup of all publicly accessible PRISA functions.
